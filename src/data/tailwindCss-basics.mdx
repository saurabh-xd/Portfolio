# Tailwind CSS Basics

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that lets you build custom user interfaces quickly by composing small, single-purpose utility classes directly in your markup. This approach reduces the need for context-switching between HTML and CSS, encourages consistency, and often leads to smaller final CSS bundles when configured properly.

## What You’ll Learn

This article covers the essentials: what Tailwind is, how it differs from traditional CSS and component libraries, how to set it up (including for Next.js), core concepts (utilities, responsive design, variants), customization, a few practical examples, best practices, and useful resources.

## Why Tailwind?

- Utility-first: build UIs by composing utilities like `p-4`, `text-gray-800`, or `flex` instead of writing new CSS classes.
- Rapid prototyping: iterate quickly without leaving your HTML or JSX.
- Predictable styling: utilities are named consistently and are easy to search for.
- Highly configurable: use the `tailwind.config.js` to adapt the design system (colors, spacing, breakpoints, etc.).

## Quick Installation (Next.js example)

Tailwind works with many build tools. For a Next.js project, the minimal install looks like this:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then add the Tailwind directives to your global CSS (e.g., `globals.css`):

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Update `tailwind.config.js` content paths so Tailwind can purge unused styles (important for small bundles):

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,mdx}', './app/**/*.{js,ts,tsx,mdx}'],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
}
```

With Next.js, restart the dev server and Tailwind utilities will be available in your components and MDX files.

## Core Concepts

- Utilities: single-purpose classes (e.g., `mt-4`, `bg-blue-500`, `rounded-lg`).
- Components: reusable groups of utilities you can extract into your own classes or use with `@apply` in CSS.
- Responsive design: Tailwind uses mobile-first breakpoints like `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` to apply utilities at specific widths.
- Variants: state and interaction modifiers like `hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`, and `dark:`.

## Example: Building a Button

Here’s a simple, reusable button written in JSX/MDX using Tailwind classes:

```jsx
export default function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600
      text-white font-medium rounded-md shadow hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none
      focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300 transition">
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

This button uses utilities for spacing, color, typography, radius, shadow, hover and focus states, and a transition.

## Responsive Layouts

Tailwind makes responsive layouts straightforward — prefix utilities with breakpoints.

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  <div class="p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">Card 1</div>
  <div class="p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">Card 2</div>
  <div class="p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">Card 3</div>
</div>
```

Here the grid switches from a single column to two columns at `md` and three at `lg`.

## Customization: theme and plugins

Tailwind’s `tailwind.config.js` allows you to extend the default theme with custom colors, fonts, spacing, and more.

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#0ea5e9',
        brand: '#f472b6',
      },
      spacing: {
        '72': '18rem',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Plugins add additional utilities and components (e.g., forms, typography):

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography
```

Then register them:

```js
plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/forms'), require('@tailwindcss/typography')]
```

## Using `@apply` for component extraction

If you want a semantic class name but still use Tailwind utilities, you can use `@apply` in a CSS file:

```css
.card {
  @apply p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow;
}
```

This gives you a `.card` you can use in markup while keeping utility-based consistency.

## Practical Example: Responsive Hero

```jsx
export function Hero() {
  return (
    <section className="bg-gradient-to-r from-sky-50 to-white py-16">
      <div className="container mx-auto px-6 md:px-8 lg:px-12">
        <div className="max-w-2xl">
          <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-extrabold text-gray-900">
            Build fast UIs with Tailwind
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
            Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that helps you create modern
            user interfaces quickly by composing small utility classes in your
            markup.
          </p>
          <div className="mt-6 flex gap-3">
            <a className="inline-block px-5 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-md
              hover:bg-blue-700 transition" href="#">Get started</a>
            <a className="inline-block px-5 py-3 border border-gray-200 rounded-md
              text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-50 transition" href="#">Learn more</a>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep utilities readable: group related utilities (layout, spacing, typography, color).
- Extract repeated patterns using components, `@apply`, or utility functions in your framework.
- Use the `content` (previously `purge`) option to remove unused styles in production.
- Prefer semantic components (e.g., `Header`, `Button`) rather than scattering raw HTML everywhere.
- Leverage the design tokens in `tailwind.config.js` to keep a consistent visual language.

## Debugging and Performance

- If a utility isn’t taking effect, check for specificity conflicts or a missing `className` value in JSX.
- Ensure Tailwind is scanning all files that include classes (MDX, JSX, TSX) — update `content` paths.
- Use the devtools plugin or browser inspector to see which CSS rule applies.
- Production: generate a minimized CSS bundle by running a production build — Tailwind removes unused utilities when configured properly.

## When Not to Use Tailwind

Tailwind favors inline utility composition. If you prefer writing long, semantic CSS with heavy use of class names per component or if you rely on a third-party design system that expects custom CSS classes, Tailwind may not fit perfectly. Also, teams with strict separation of concerns might resist markup-heavy styles.

## Learning Resources

- Official docs: https://tailwindcss.com — comprehensive guides and examples.
- Play CDN: quick experiments with classes at https://play.tailwindcss.com.
- Component libraries: Headless UI, Tailwind UI (paid), and community component sets.

## Conclusion

Tailwind CSS changes how you think about styling by moving composition into the markup. The learning curve is mostly about familiarizing yourself with the utility names and how to organize them. Once adopted, Tailwind can speed up development, improve consistency, and reduce the mental overhead of custom CSS. Start small, extract patterns into components, and tailor the `tailwind.config.js` to match your brand for the best results.

# Tailwind CSS Basics

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps you build modern designs without leaving your HTML. Instead of writing custom CSS, you compose designs using predefined utility classes.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS provides low-level utility classes that let you build custom designs quickly. It's different from component frameworks like Bootstrap because it focuses on utility classes rather than pre-built components.

## Installation

Install Tailwind CSS using npm:
