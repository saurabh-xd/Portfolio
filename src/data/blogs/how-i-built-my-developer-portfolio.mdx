## Why I’m Writing This Blog

This is my first blog post.

I was making a portfolio website, and I thought of adding a blog page since I have seen that most portfolio websites have one. This blog is just random I don’t know what to write, so I’m just writing my random thoughts here. So stay tuned.

## Who Am I?

My name is Saurabh, and I am a CS student currently learning web development. I chose web development because it’s cool? Nah. I chose web development because I thought CS was all about web development dumb me. But now I have an idea of what CS is and its potential, and I will try to keep exploring and learning new things and update my journey through my blogs.

## What’s Next?

One year ago, I had no plan, no goals, and no desire for anything. But now, after joining college, I have some goals to complete, and I will work hard to achieve them.
