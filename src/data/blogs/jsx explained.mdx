When I first started learning React, one thing felt very strange:

> "Why am I writing HTML inside JavaScript?"

It looked weird. It felt wrong. But once I understood it, I realized this is actually **one of the biggest superpowers of React**.

That "HTML inside JavaScript" is called **JSX**.

---

##  What is JSX?

JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**.

It lets you write HTML like code directly within JavaScript like this:

```jsx
const Button = () => {
  return <button>Click me</button>;
};
```

This is not HTML.

This is JavaScript that looks like HTML.

Behind the scenes, React converts this into normal JavaScript function calls.

##  The Old Way (Before React)

Earlier, we used to write:

- HTML in one file
- JavaScript in another file
- And connect them using IDs and DOM methods

Some problems with this approach:

- UI and logic were separated
- Code was hard to maintain
- Changing UI based on data was messy

---

##  The React Way

In React, you write UI and logic together in components:

```jsx
function Profile({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
}
```

Now:

- UI depends directly on data
- No manual DOM updates
- Everything is component-based

---

##  Why JSX Feels Like Magic

### 1. You can use JavaScript inside UI

```jsx
<h1>Hello {user.name}</h1>
{isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Login />}
```

UI becomes dynamic and smart.

### 2. UI becomes just JavaScript

You can:

- Store components in variables
- Pass them as props
- Return them from functions

This makes your UI composable and reusable.

### 3. Logic and UI stay together (which is actually good)

In real life:

- UI changes because of logic
- Logic exists because of UI

So keeping them together in one file makes code easier to understand and maintain.

## ⚙️ But How Does the Browser Understand JSX?

The browser does not understand JSX.

Tools like:

- Babel
- Next.js
- Vite

convert this:

```jsx
<h1>Hello</h1>
```

into:

```javascript
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");
```

So JSX is just a developer-friendly syntax.
